# Update to `kernel1Seq_run`

We can now output the sparse graph produced by kernel 1 to a file. To do so we use the `-o` flag followed by the name of the output file. For example, the following command will convert the edge representation in `edges.data` to an adjacency-list sparse graph representation in `sparse.data`.

```
$ kernel1Seq_run.exe edges.data -o sparse.data 
```
# Kernel 2 and 3 


## Sampling Search Keys

Kernel 2 and 3 both require a list of sample vertices on which their start on. These samples can be generated by feeding the sparse graph file, `sparse.data` to `sampleSearchKeys.exe` as follows.


```
$ sampleSearchKeys.exe sparse.data -o samples.data
```
## Running the kernel 2 and 3

The order of the input files fed into the executables matters. The following command will perform kernel 2.

```
$ kernel2Seq_run.exe sparse.data samples.data 
```

Kernel 3's executable is used exactly the same way as kernel 2's executable.

_Note:_ The output flag is important in kernel 1 because the sparse graph representation in `sparse.data` has to be fed into kernel 2 and kernel 3. The outputs of kernel 2 and kernel 3 don't need to be used for now so their executables do not have an optional output flag.
